# Problem Overview
# Upgrade activity 1 and add the following features:
# ▪ Added a new component called ViewCart which displays a list of items in the shopping cart and allows users to remove items from the cart. It should have a Checkout button that will the cart once checkout button is triggered and return to product pages.
# ▪ Each item in the cart is displayed as a list item that apply Bootstrap's. Each item includes the product name, price, and a "Remove" button.
# ▪ The removeFromCart function is passed down as a prop to ViewCart, which allows users to remove items from the cart by clicking the "Remove" button.
# ▪ Bootstrap classes (btn, btn-primary, btn-danger, card, etc.) are used for styling the components to ensure a visually appealing and responsive design.
# ▪ The Product component now includes a button styled with Bootstrap's btn and btn -primary classes for adding products to the cart.
# ▪ You should apply routes and navigation in this activity. You should have a home page that displays the company logo (choose your desired logo) and button Proceed to Shopping. Once the Proceed to Shopping is clicked it will show a list of products where the user can add item to cart. When the user clicks My Cart, it will display the ViewCart component that shows cart item.
